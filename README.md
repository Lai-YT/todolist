    Todolist is a simple todo list API server,
    <br>
    allowing you to add, remove, and mark tasks as done.
</p>

## Brief

This project is a simple endeavor to learn _Go_, following the blog post [Build a Todolist API Server in Golang](https://www.fadhil-blog.dev/blog/golang-todolist/) with a few modifications.

The API server uses:

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) as our database
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html) as the ORM to interact with our database
- Request routing using [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
- [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) for logging
